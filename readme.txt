# MAIC2022-MORABARABA
Sixth edition of the Mify Artificial Intelligence Contest #MIFY #AAAIBenin


## Setup

The game was implemented in **Python** and works with versions greater than or equal to **3.6+**.

### Get Python and dependencies


You can download the **3.6+** version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
(Don't forget to add python to the path if you are on Windows)

Next, install the dependencies for the game. For that just run the following command (Note that you may replace *pip* by *pip3* if you have different versions of python).


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the code

Firstly, just clone this repository or download the zip to get everything you need to work and just run by following the instructions. Get exemple AI at ./faronona/random_agent.py


**Usage:**

      python main.py -ai0 ai_0.py -ai1 ai_1.py -s 0.5


      -ai0 
          path to the ai that will play as player 0
      -ai1 
           path to the ai that will play as player 1
      -s 
           time(in second) to show the board(or a move)
      -t
           total number of seconds credited to each agent


**Example:**

        python main.py -ai0 ./morabaraba/random_agent.py -ai1 ./morabaraba/random_agent2.py -s 1



### Allowed time for each AI
The t option allows you to specify the overall time allowed for all of you AI moves. After this time is exhausted all the next moves for the AI is done by a random agent.
Now to run it you will have to use another file which is **main.py** with the same settings.

**Example:**

        python main.py -ai0 ./morabaraba/random_agent.py -ai1 ./morabaraba/random_agent2.py -s 1 -t 5.0


# AI Implementation
Use the file ./morabaraba/random_agent.py as a template for your implementation. In this file you only have two things to do : 
 - Change the name of the AI through the class attribute name
 - Override the play function of the class to return an action

# AI submission
Once your submission file is ready, compress it into a .zip file, don't put it in a folder before compressing it. Go to the web platform and submit your AI
